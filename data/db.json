            "description": "Jayne Erixour believes she knows everything about the universe. As a bounty hunter and assassin, she’s seen the worst dregs of humanity and every sentient species ever spat out of a hell realm. To her, there is no truth outside of her blaster’s recoil and her resolve to let no one get too close. Hadrian Scalera is on the run from the same brutal assassins who slaughtered every member of his family, both birth and foster. He has no refuge and no one he dares to call friend, as it will mean the end of them. He expects no mercy from anyone, until the day one assassin hesitates to pull the trigger. An assassin’s code is simple: Kill or be killed. No prey, no pay. Every life has a price. If Jayne doesn’t fulfill her contract and kill Hadrian, she’ll be the next target on the League’s menu. But as old enemies return to hunt them both, they quickly learn that neither will survive unless they can learn to trust each other. Yet things are never so simple and survival means only one of them can be left standing . . .",

After talking her way into a job in Chicago, young journalist Jules Roth is given an unusual assignment: locate a painting stolen by the Nazis more than 75 years ago. The painting? None other than legendary artist Ernst Engel's most famous work, Woman on Fire. A dying designer covets the portrait for deeply personal reasons. Jules doesn't have much time. Meanwhile, in Europe, Margaux de Laurent – powerful heir to her family's millions – also searches for the painting. A cunning gallerist who gets everything she wants, the only thing standing in her way is Jules. Yet Jules has resources of her own, including the designer's grandson, Adam. A recovering addict and artist in his own right, Adam was once in Margaux's clutches, and he'll do anything to help Jules locate the painting first. Woman on Fire is a thrilling tale of secrets, love, sacrifice and an exquisite work of art that burns bright, moving through hands, hearts and history. ___________ PRAISE FOR WOMAN ON FIRE: 'Part-thriller, part-historical fiction, this book will have you gripping the pages until the very end' Buzzfeed 'Addictively propulsive and laced with rapid-fire twists and turns, this sizzling tale crackles with tension' Kristin Harmel 'Thick with history, scandal, romance and deceit... A truly compulsive read' Mary Kubica 'An exuberant thriller laced with sex, art, and history' Alyson Richman 'Had me on the edge of my seat' Fiona Davis",

As a bounty hunter and assassin, she’s seen the worst dregs of humanity and every sentient species ever spat out of a hell realm. To her, there is no truth outside of her blaster’s recoil and her resolve to let no one get too close. Hadrian Scalera is on the run from the same brutal assassins who slaughtered every member of his family, both birth and foster. He has no refuge and no one he dares to call friend, as it will mean the end of them. He expects no mercy from anyone, until the day one assassin hesitates to pull the trigger. An assassin’s code is simple: Kill or be killed. No prey, no pay. Every life has a price. If Jayne doesn’t fulfill her contract and kill Hadrian, she’ll be the next target on the League’s menu. But as old enemies return to hunt them both, they quickly learn that neither will survive unless they can learn to trust each other. Yet things are never so simple and survival means only one of them can be left standing . . .",

A cunning gallerist who gets everything she wants, the only thing standing in her way is Jules. Yet Jules has resources of her own, including the designer's grandson, Adam. A recovering addict and artist in his own right, Adam was once in Margaux's clutches, and he'll do anything to help Jules locate the painting first. Woman on Fire is a thrilling tale of secrets, love, sacrifice and an exquisite work of art that burns bright, moving through hands, hearts and history. ___________ PRAISE FOR WOMAN ON FIRE: 'Part-thriller, part-historical fiction, this book will have you gripping the pages until the very end' Buzzfeed 'Addictively propulsive and laced with rapid-fire twists and turns, this sizzling tale crackles with tension' Kristin Harmel 'Thick with history, scandal, romance and deceit... A truly compulsive read' Mary Kubica 'An exuberant thriller laced with sex, art, and history' Alyson Richman 'Had me on the edge of my seat' Fiona Davis",

To her, there is no truth outside of her blaster’s recoil and her resolve to let no one get too close. Hadrian Scalera is on the run from the same brutal assassins who slaughtered every member of his family, both birth and foster. He has no refuge and no one he dares to call friend, as it will mean the end of them. He expects no mercy from anyone, until the day one assassin hesitates to pull the trigger.

            "description": "THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: OVER 15 MILLION COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now. People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.' Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck 'James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones.' Adam Grant, author of Originals 'Atomic Habits is a step-by-step manual for changing routines.' Books of the Month, Financial Times 'A special book that will change how you approach your day and live your life.'
